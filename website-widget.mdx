## 1. Widget Type Configuration

You can choose between two widget styles:

	•	Contained: Full widget with header text and a button.

	•	Compact: Minimalist version—just a button with icon and text.

✅ Recommended: Compact for modern sites with minimal UI.

## 2. Positioning the Widget

Set how the widget appears on your page:

	•	Fixed Position: Stays anchored to a corner (e.g., bottom-right) as users scroll.

	•	Static Position: Scrolls naturally with the rest of the page content.

⸻

### 3. Text Customization

Update what users see at various widget stages:

**Button Text**: e.g., Start a call

**Setup Feedback**: e.g., Setting up the call...

**Interaction Help**: e.g., Click to get support

**Connecting Text:** e.g., Connecting the line...

You can also adjust:

	•	Font Size & Color for all text.

	•	Floating Text:

Optional label below widget (e.g., “Powered by [welco.ai](http://welco.ai)”), with custom URL and styling.

## 4. Live Preview

As you edit your settings, a real-time preview appears on the right-hand panel so you can instantly visualize the final look.

### 5. Embedding the Widget

Once customized:

	1.	Click Copy Code next to the “Widget Embed Code” section.

	2.	Paste the embed snippet into your site’s HTML, right before the closing \</body\> tag:

This loads the widget with your saved configuration.

## 6. Best Practices

	•	Place the code on every page you want the widget to appear.

	•	Keep the text concise so users don’t think it’s a chatbot or voicemail.

	•	Set the widget to a corner of the screen (typically bottom-right) for visibility but non-intrusion.
