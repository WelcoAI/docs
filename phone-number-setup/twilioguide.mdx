## Before You Start

### Requirements

When you import a Twilio number:

## Step 1: Get Your Twilio Credentials

### Find Your Account SID and Auth Token

1. Log into your [**Twilio Console**](https://help.twilio.com/articles/14726256820123-What-is-a-Twilio-Account-SID-and-where-can-I-find-it-) at `console.twilio.com`
2. On the main dashboard, you'll see your account information
3. **Account SID**: Copy the long string starting with "AC" (like `ACxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`)
4. **Auth Token**: Click **"Show"** next to the Auth Token and copy it
5. **Keep these secure** - you'll enter them in Welco

<Info>
  **Security Note**: Your Auth Token is sensitive. Never share it publicly or store it in unsecured locations.
</Info>

### Identify Your Phone Number

1. In Twilio Console, go to **Phone Numbers \> Manage \> Active numbers**
2. **Find the number** you want to import to Welco
3. **Note the format**: It should be in international format like `+1234567890`
