# Business Hours Setup

Configure when your Welco AI receptionist routes calls to human agents versus handling them with AI. Set up custom schedules, define after-hours behavior, and ensure seamless call routing based on your business operating hours.

## Prerequisites

Before configuring business hours, ensure you have:

- A Welco account with an active AI receptionist
- A phone number configured for human agent routing
- Your business timezone configured in your profile settings
- Agent and tenant IDs properly set up in your account

## Understanding Call Routing Logic

Welco uses a smart routing system that determines whether incoming calls should go to your human agents or the AI receptionist based on your configured business hours:

**During Business Hours:**

- Calls are routed to your human agent's phone number
- If the human agent doesn't answer within the timeout period, the call automatically transfers to the AI receptionist
- The system respects your configured business days and hours

**Outside Business Hours:**

- All calls are handled directly by the AI receptionist
- No attempt is made to reach human agents
- Callers receive immediate AI assistance

### Step 1: Enable Business Hours Routing

1. **Toggle Business Hours Routing**: Enable the "Enable business hours routing" switch
   - When enabled: Calls route based on your schedule
   - When disabled: All calls go directly to the AI receptionist

<Info>
  ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Start with business hours routing disabled to test your AI receptionist behavior before adding human agent routing.
</Info>

### Step 2: Configure Human Agent Phone Number

1. **Enter Phone Number**: Input your human agent's phone number using the international phone selector
   - The system supports international numbers with proper country code formatting
   - Use the dropdown to select your country and enter the local number
   - Example: For US number (555) 123-4567, select "United States" and enter the number
2. **Verify Format**: The system automatically formats your number in E.164 format (e.g., +15551234567)

### Step 3: Set Call Timeout Duration

1. **Configure Timeout**: Set how long the system waits for your human agent to answer
   - **Range**: 5-60 seconds
   - **Default**: 20 seconds
   - **Recommended**: 15-25 seconds for optimal user experience
2. **Understand Timeout Behavior**:
   - If the human agent answers within the timeout: Call proceeds normally
   - If no answer within timeout: Call automatically transfers to AI receptionist
   - The caller experiences a seamless transition without disruption

## Configuring Business Hours Schedule

### Daily Schedule Configuration

For each day of the week, you can:

1. **Enable/Disable**: Toggle whether the day is a business day
2. **Set Hours**: Configure start and end times using 24-hour format
   - Start Time: When human agents begin taking calls
   - End Time: When human agents stop taking calls

**Default Configuration:**

- **Monday-Friday**: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM (enabled)
