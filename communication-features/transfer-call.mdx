# Call Transfer Setup

Configure intelligent call routing scenarios to automatically transfer calls to human agents when specific conditions are met or when the AI determines human intervention is needed.

## What It Does

Call transfer setup allows your AI receptionist to:

- Route calls to specific phone numbers based on conversation content
- Transfer complex inquiries to human specialists
- Escalate calls when AI reaches its capability limits
- Provide seamless handoffs with context preservation
- Deliver custom messages before transferring

## When to Use

**Always Enable For:**

- Businesses with human agents available during business hours
- Complex services requiring specialist knowledge
- Sales conversations that need human closing
- Emergency or urgent situations requiring immediate human attention
- Customer complaints or sensitive issues

**Configure Multiple Scenarios For:**

- Different departments (sales, support, billing)
- Specialist routing (doctor types, legal areas, technical experts)
- Escalation levels (manager, supervisor, owner)
- Time-based routing (business hours, after-hours, weekends)
