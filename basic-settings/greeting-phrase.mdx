## Agent Greeting Messages

### Understanding Greeting Impact

Your greeting message is the first interaction callers have with your business. A well-crafted greeting:

- Sets professional expectations
- Reduces caller anxiety about speaking with AI
- Clearly communicates your business value
- Guides callers toward successful outcomes
- Reflects your brand personality

### Step-by-Step Greeting Setup

#### Step 1: Access Greeting Configuration

![Screenshot2025 09 24at2 13 09PM Pn](/images/Screenshot2025-09-24at2.13.09PM.png)

1. In your agent configuration panel, locate **Greeting Phrase**
2. Click **Edit Greeting** or the pencil icon
3. You'll see a text editor with your current greeting (or a default template)

#### Step 2: Craft Your Greeting Message

Use this proven structure for maximum effectiveness:

```
[Warm Welcome] + [Business Name] + [AI Introduction] + [Value Statement] + [Call to Action]
```

**Template Example:**

```
"Hello and thank you for calling [Your Business Name]! I'm [Business Name]'s AI assistant,
here to help you with [primary services/value]. How can I make your day better?"
```

#### Step 3: Customize for Your Business

**For Medical Practices:**

```
"Hi! Thank you for calling Riverside Family Medicine. I'm your AI scheduling assistant,
ready to help you book appointments, answer questions about our services, or connect
you with our care team. What can I help you with today?"
```

**For Restaurants:**

```
"Good [morning/afternoon/evening]! Welcome to Mama Rosa's Italian Kitchen. I'm here
to help with reservations, answer questions about our menu, or tell you about today's
specials. How can I make your dining experience wonderful?"
```

**For Service Businesses:**

```
"Hello! You've reached ProClean Home Services. I'm your AI assistant, here to help
schedule cleanings, provide service quotes, or answer questions about our cleaning
solutions. What brings you to ProClean today?"
```

**For Professional Services:**

```
"Good [time of day], thank you for calling Johnson & Associates CPA. I'm the AI
assistant helping with appointments and initial consultations. I can also answer
general questions about our tax and accounting services. How may I assist you?"
```

#### Holiday and Special Event Greetings

Set temporary greetings for special occasions:

**Holiday Example:**

```
"Happy holidays! Thank you for calling [Business Name]. I'm your AI assistant,
and I'm here to help even during the holiday season with [services].
How can I help make your holidays better?"
```

**Special Promotion Example:**

```
"Hello and thank you for calling [Business Name]! I'm your AI assistant.
This month we're excited to offer [brief promotion mention], and I'm here to help
with that or any of our regular services. What can I do for you today?"
```

## Common Greeting Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Greeting Sounds Too Robotic

**Problem:** The AI delivery lacks warmth and natural flow.

**Solutions:**

- Add conversational elements like "Thanks for calling" instead of "Thank you for calling"
- Include natural pauses with punctuation
- Use contractions and casual connecting words
- Test with [different voice settings](https://docs.welco.ai/basic-settings/voice-models) if available

**Before:**

```
"Hello. Thank you for calling ABC Company. I am an artificial intelligence assistant.
I can help you with scheduling and information. What do you need?"
```

**After:**

```
"Hi there! Thanks for calling ABC Company. I'm your AI assistant, and I'm here to help
with scheduling, questions, or connecting you with our team. What can I do for you today?"
```

### Issue: Greeting is Too Long

**Problem:** Callers hang up before the greeting finishes or lose attention.

**Solutions:**

- Cut unnecessary words and phrases
- Front-load the most important information
- Combine related concepts into single statements
- Test the timing with actual speech

**Before (35+ seconds):**

```
"Hello and thank you very much for calling Premier Home Services, your trusted local
provider of comprehensive home maintenance, repair, and improvement solutions. I am
the artificial intelligence assistant system here to provide you with information
about our services, help you schedule appointments, connect you with our expert
technicians, or answer any questions you might have about our company.
Please tell me how I can be of assistance to you today."
```

**After (20 seconds):**

```
"Hi! Thanks for calling Premier Home Services. I'm your AI assistant, ready to help
with scheduling, service questions, or connecting you with our expert technicians.
What can I help you with today?"
```

### Issue: Unclear Business Identity

**Problem:** Callers aren't sure they've reached the right business.

**Solutions:**

- Lead with your business name clearly
- Include location if you have multiple offices
- Mention your primary service area or specialty
- Avoid acronyms or shortened business names

**Before:**

```
"Hello, thanks for calling. I'm an AI assistant here to help with your needs.
What can I do for you?"
```

**After:**

```
"Hi! You've reached Downtown Dental Associates on Main Street. I'm Dr. Johnson's AI
scheduling assistant, here to help with appointments and dental care questions.
How can I help you today?"
```

## Next Steps

After configuring your greeting:

1. **Test thoroughly** with multiple scenarios and caller types
2. **Monitor performance** using the metrics discussed above
3. **Iterate and improve** based on real-world usage data
4. **Configure speaking style** to ensure consistency with your greeting tone
5. **Set up workflows** that naturally follow from your greeting's call-to-action

A well-crafted greeting is the foundation of excellent AI receptionist performance. Take time to get it right, and don't hesitate to refine it based on actual caller interactions and feedback.
