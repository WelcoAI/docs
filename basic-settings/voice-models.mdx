### Voice Processing Models

#### **Real-time Voice Models**

Real-time models process audio streams continuously, enabling natural conversation flow with minimal latency.

**OpenAI Realtime API:**

- **Latency**: 200-400ms end-to-end
- **Technology**: Direct audio-to-audio processing
- **Experience**: Natural conversation interruptions and overlapping speech
- **Quality**: High-quality with optimized real-time performance
- **Best for**: Interactive conversations requiring immediate responses

#### **Traditional TTS/STT Models**

Traditional models use separate Speech-to-Text and Text-to-Speech processing with AI reasoning in between.

**Processing Flow:**

```
Caller Speech → STT → AI Processing → TTS → AI Response
   ~200ms      ~500ms    ~300ms     ~400ms
Total: ~1400ms average latency
```

**Advantages:**

- **Higher accuracy**: More processing time allows for better transcription
- **Better reasoning**: AI has full text context for complex decision making
- **Flexibility**: Can modify, analyze, and optimize text before speech synthesis
- **Debugging**: Full visibility into conversation transcripts

**Trade-offs:**

- **Higher latency**: Multiple processing steps create longer response times
- **Less natural flow**: Pauses between caller speech and AI response
- **Interruption handling**: More difficult to handle natural conversation overlaps

### Technology Comparison

| Aspect                    | Real-time Models                | TTS/STT Models                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **End-to-end Latency**    | 200-500ms                       | 800-1500ms                          |
| **Conversation Flow**     | Natural, interruptible          | Turn-based with pauses              |
| **Processing Visibility** | Limited (audio-to-audio)        | Full (complete transcripts)         |
| **Accuracy**              | Good (optimized for speed)      | Excellent (optimized for precision) |
| **Complex Reasoning**     | Limited (real-time constraints) | Superior (full context available)   |
| **Interruption Handling** | Native support                  | Requires special handling           |
| **Debugging**             | Audio-based only                | Full text-based analysis            |
| **Cost**                  | Higher (specialized models)     | Lower (standard APIs)               |
