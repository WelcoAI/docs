# Ambient Background Noise

Add subtle background sounds during AI processing delays to eliminate awkward silence and give callers the impression that something is actively happening.

## What It Does

Ambient background noise plays gentle sounds during AI processing time to:

- Fill silence gaps while the AI is thinking or processing
- Create the impression of an active, working environment
- Reduce caller anxiety during processing delays
- Make conversations feel more natural and engaging
- Prevent callers from thinking the call has dropped

**Available Background Sounds:**

- Soft keyboard typing sounds
- Gentle paper rustling
- Quiet office ambience
- Subtle pen clicking
- Light computer processing sounds

## When to Use

**Always Enable For:**

- High-latency AI models (TTS/STT with 800ms+ response times)
- Complex workflows requiring processing time
- Businesses where professional "working" atmosphere is important
- Callers who may be unfamiliar with AI interactions

**Consider Disabling For:**

- Real-time AI models with very low latency (under 400ms)
- Situations where complete silence is preferred
- Medical or sensitive conversations where sounds might be distracting

## How to Configure

### Basic Setup

1. Navigate to **AI Receptionist** â†’ **Advanced Settings**
2. Find **Ambient Background Noise** section
3. Toggle **Enable Background Sounds**

Ambient background noise improves caller experience by making processing delays feel more natural and professional.
