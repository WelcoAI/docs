# Auto-Hangup Configuration

Set intelligent conditions for automatically ending calls to improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary call duration while maintaining a professional caller experience.

## Understanding Auto-Hangup Types

Your AI receptionist supports two main auto-hangup mechanisms:

### **Silence-Based Hangup**

Automatically ends calls after a specified period of silence from the caller.

### **Interaction-Based Hangup**

Ends calls after completing the intended interaction with a custom farewell message.

## Accessing Auto-Hangup Settings
