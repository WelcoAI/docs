Welco allows you to upload and manage company-specific information so your AI receptionist can give accurate, brand-aligned answers to callers. This is done via the **Knowledge Base (Company Information)** section.

You can add knowledge through:

- Text entries
- Website URLs (crawled)
- Uploaded documents (PDF, DOCX, or TXT)

### **Step 1: Navigate to the Knowledge Base**

1. Go to **Configuration \> Receptionist**.
2. Scroll to the section labeled **Knowledge Base (Company Information)**.

This is where you’ll manage the documents and content your AI will reference during calls.

### **Step 2: Choose a Method to Add Information**

You have three ways to input business data:

#### **1. Add Text**

- Click the **\+ Add Text** button.
- Paste or write your content directly (e.g., About Us, Services, Processes, FAQs).
- Save the entry.
- You can toggle visibility (Active/Inactive), edit, or delete it anytime.

#### **2. Add Website URL**

- Click **Add Website URL**.
- In the pop-up modal, enter the full URL (e.g., https://yourwebsite.com).
- Click **Crawl**. Welco will extract content from the linked page.
- This allows automatic data refresh if your site changes.

#### **3. Upload Documents**

- Click **Upload Document**.
- Supported file types: **PDF**, **DOCX**, or **TXT**.
- Limit: You can upload up to **4 documents**, each with a **10,000-word limit**.
- These documents are parsed by the AI for relevant business knowledge.

### **Step 3: Review and Manage Content**

Once added, each item will appear in the list with:

![ai receptionist content](/images/Screenshot2025-05-24at10.53.46AM.png)

- **Type**: Whether it’s text, link, or document
- **Content Preview**: The title and first few words
- **Status Toggle**: Turn entries on or off at any time
- **Update Method**: Set to Manual by default; links can be refreshed periodically
- **Actions**: Edit, delete, or preview any entry

To refresh crawled URLs, use the **Refresh** button at the top right.

### **Best Practices**

- Keep your entries focused and organized by category (e.g., Services, Policies, Location).
- Use headings (#) for better AI parsing.
- Avoid uploading duplicate information in multiple formats (e.g., both PDF and Text).
- Regularly audit your knowledge base to keep it accurate and relevant.
