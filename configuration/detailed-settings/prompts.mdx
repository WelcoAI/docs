The **Speaking Style** setting in Welco defines how your AI receptionist should behave on calls — including tone, attitude, and boundaries. This is done through a customizable prompt located in the **Basic Settings** section.

### **What Is the AI Prompt?**

This prompt gives context to your AI receptionist. It outlines your business type, what the AI should do, and how it should speak to callers.

By default, Welco provides a general-purpose prompt suitable for most businesses.

Example:

> You are an AI receptionist for NovaCare Dental, a professional dental practice. Your role is to greet visitors, provide information about services, answer common questions, and assist with appointment scheduling, all in a friendly and professional manner. Please ensure your responses are clear, helpful, and courteous. Do not attempt to diagnose or provide medical advice.

### **Tips for Writing a Good Prompt**

- **Be specific about your business type.** This helps the AI tailor its responses.
- **Define the AI’s tone.** For example: friendly, professional, casual, formal.
- **Set boundaries.** Clearly state what the AI should not do (e.g., “Do not give legal advice”).
- **Mention any unique instructions.** For example, “If a caller mentions an emergency, take a message and escalate immediately.”

### **Use Case Examples**

- For a dental clinic:

  > Your role is to assist with appointment scheduling and insurance questions in a calm, caring tone.
- For a home repair service:

  > You should answer basic service inquiries and offer to dispatch a technician if needed, using a helpful and upbeat tone.
