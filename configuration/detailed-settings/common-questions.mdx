### **How to Format Questions and Answers**

![add FAQs](/images/Screenshot2025-05-24at11.07.54AM.png)

Each FAQ should follow this strict format for the AI to understand and reference them correctly:

```
Question: [your question]
Answer: [your answer]
```

Each **question and answer pair must be in separate paragraphs**. Here are some examples:

```
Question: Where are you located?
Answer: We are located at 132 Linkin Park, New York.

Question: How many other branches do you have?
Answer: We don't have any subsidiary branches.
```

Avoid using bullet points or other formatting styles — stick to plain text.
