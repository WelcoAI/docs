Welco offers a professional **Voice Library** with multiple pre-configured voice styles, as well as the option to create your own voice using the **Clone Voice** feature. This allows businesses to match the receptionist’s tone and personality to their brand.

### **Using the Voice Library**

If you want your AI receptionist to sound like someone specific (e.g., a real human receptionist), use the **Clone Voice** feature.

1. Click the **Clone Voice** tab.
2. Fill in:
   - **Custom Voice Name**
   - **Custom Voice Description**
3. Choose a voice provider: **ElevenLabs** (default) or **Cartesia**.
4. Upload a recording:
   - **Select File** or **Start Recording**
   - Ensure the file is under **1 MB**.
5. Click **Create Voice Clone** to generate the voice.

Once created, your custom voice will be added to the library and available for selection.

### **Best Practices**

- Use a **clear, neutral accent** for general audiences.
- Choose an **upbeat voice** for service businesses, or a **calm voice** for medical, dental, or legal practices.
- Only use custom cloning if you have a consistent voice in your branding or someone familiar to your callers.
