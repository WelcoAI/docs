Your AI receptionist’s greeting is the very first impression callers will hear. Welco allows you to customize this greeting to match your business tone and branding.

### **What Is a Greeting Phrase?**

The **Greeting Phrase** is the opening line your AI receptionist uses to answer every incoming call. It’s displayed under **Basic Settings \> Greeting Phrase** in your Welco dashboard.

Example:

> “Hello, welcome to NovaCare Dental. How can I help you today?”

### **Best Practices**

- **Keep it short and natural.** Long greetings can sound robotic or like voicemail, causing callers to hang up.
- **Include your business name** so the caller knows they reached the right place.
- **Avoid overloading** with information like office hours or menus — your AI can guide them after the greeting.

Recommended format:

> “Welcome to [Your Business Name], how may I help you?”
