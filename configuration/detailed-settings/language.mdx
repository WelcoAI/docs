### **Important Consideration**

**Please Note:**

> Our internal data shows that **over 90% of callers hang up** when they hear a language selection prompt at the start of a call.

For this reason, we **do not recommend** using multilingual prompts unless your customer base is **consistently split** between languages. Instead, it’s often better to set the language based on the customer’s profile, caller location, or business hours routing.

### **Best Practice Recommendations**

- Use **English-only** unless you serve large groups of non-English speakers.
- Consider duplicating your Welco setup if you operate in multiple regions (e.g., English line \+ Spanish line).
- Avoid long language menus — keep the experience fast and seamless.
