Welco’s AI Copilot doesn’t just interpret your instructions — it translates them into real call-handling logic. When you describe what your receptionist should do, Welco generates a scenario configuration with questions, triggers, and logic ready to deploy.

### **How It Works**

1. Go to **Configuration \> Receptionist**.
2. In the **Quick Customize** section, describe your desired AI behavior. For example:

   > I want my AI to collect callers’ names and email addresses when they request a follow-up.
3. Welco processes this request and builds a scenario configuration automatically.

### **Generated Scenario Example**

Once your prompt is processed, a scenario card is generated with the following fields:

- **Scenario Description**

  Choose when this logic should apply — for example:
  - Beginning of Call
  - After specific keywords
  - After a failed transfer attempt
- **Questions**

  Welco auto-generates questions that your AI receptionist will ask. In this case:
  - “May I please have your full name?”
  - “Could you provide your email address for follow-up?”

You can further customize the scenario by:

- Editing any question
- Removing unnecessary questions
- Adding more questions by clicking **\+ Add Questions**

### **Saving Your Customization**

After reviewing and adjusting the scenario:

1. Click the **Update now** button.
2. Your changes will be applied instantly to live calls.

### **Use Cases**

This feature can be used to:

- Gather lead information
- Qualify callers before transfer
- Route calls based on custom logic
- Trigger follow-up emails or CRM entries
