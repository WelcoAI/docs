2. Use the format: `https://example.com/page-name`
3. Ensure the URL is publicly accessible and contains text content

**Important**: Only enter one URL at a time. Each website page requires a separate import.

4. Wait for the success confirmation message

## URL Format Requirements

Your website URLs must meet these criteria:

- **Complete URLs**: Include `https://` or `http://` prefix
- **Public Access**: URLs must be accessible without login or authentication
- **Valid Format**: Follow standard URL structure (e.g., `https://example.com/about`)
- **Content-Rich Pages**: Pages should contain meaningful text content for training

### Supported URL Examples

- `https://yourcompany.com/about`
- `https://yourcompany.com/services/consulting`
- `https://yourcompany.com/contact`
- `https://blog.yourcompany.com/latest-post`

## How Web Content is Processed

When you import a website URL:

1. **Content Extraction**: The system crawls the specified webpage and extracts text content
2. **Processing**: The content is analyzed and formatted for AI training
3. **Integration**: The processed content becomes part of your knowledge base
4. **Training**: Your AI assistant learns from the imported website information

ℹ️ **Note**: The system imports content from the specific URL provided. It does not crawl linked pages or subdirectories automatically.
