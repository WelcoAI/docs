## Best Practices for FAQ Pairs

### Writing Effective Questions

**Stay Focused**: Each question should address one specific topic

### Writing Helpful Answers

**Complete Information**: Include all details needed to fully answer the question
**Clear Structure**: Use simple sentences and logical organization
**Actionable Details**: Provide specific steps, times, prices, or contact information when relevant
**Professional Tone**: Maintain your brand voice while being helpful and informative

### Content Examples

**Business Hours FAQ**

- Question: "When are you open?"
- Answer: "Our office is open Monday through Friday from 8 AM to 6 PM, and Saturday from 9 AM to 2 PM. We're closed Sundays and major holidays. For after-hours emergencies, please call our emergency line at (555) 123-4567."

**Service Pricing FAQ**

- Question: "How much does a consultation cost?"
- Answer: "Initial consultations are $150 for the first hour, with a complimentary 15-minute phone consultation available. Follow-up sessions are $125 per hour. We accept cash, check, and all major credit cards."
