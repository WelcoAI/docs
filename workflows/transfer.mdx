> Transfer the caller to the billing department when they mention refunds or invoices.

#### **2. Phone Number**

### **Advanced Settings**

#### **Backup Numbers (Optional)**

Add one or more backup phone numbers in case the primary contact is unavailable.

#### **Call Whisper Settings**

Choose how the transfer is handled:

- **Cold Transfer** (Without Whisper):

  The call is transferred directly with no message to the recipient.
- **Hot Transfer** (With Whisper):

  The recipient hears a brief summary or intro from the AI before the caller is connected.

#### **Call Transferee’s Settings**

Choose whether the recipient sees the **original caller ID** or **Welco’s number**.

---

### **Best Practices**

- Keep your voice response brief and polite.
- Use hot transfers for high-touch situations (e.g., sales).
- Use backup numbers if you want failover reliability.
- Clearly label each scenario to avoid confusion when managing workflows later.
