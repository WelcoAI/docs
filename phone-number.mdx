When you sign up, Welco automatically assigns you a dedicated phone number. This number appears at the **top left corner of your dashboard**, highlighted with a light blue background for easy visibility.

You can use this number in two ways:

- **As your primary business line**: Publish it on your website, business cards, and marketing materials.
- **By forwarding calls from your existing business number**: Redirect calls from your current business line to your Welco number, so Welco can answer every call with your AI receptionist.
