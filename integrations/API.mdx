description: "Set up real-time API integrations in Welco to fetch or submit data during calls. Supports headers, query params, and all HTTP methods for dynamic workflows."

Welco’s advanced **API Integration** feature allows your AI receptionist to make live API requests during a call. This enables dynamic two-way communication with external systems — such as retrieving a customer’s order, checking inventory, submitting lead data, and more.

This is ideal for businesses with custom CRMs, booking systems, or proprietary workflows.

### **Key Capabilities**

- Make **GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE** requests during a live call.
- Use **query parameters** or **headers** to pass dynamic values.
- Trigger workflows based on the caller’s intent or a scenario.
- Respond in real-time using the fetched data.
- Pass data to the API using intake forms or prior inputs.

### **How to Set Up an API Workflow**

#### **Step 1: Add New Workflow**

1. Go to **Configuration \> Real-Time Integrations \> API Integration**.
2. Click the **\+ Add** button.

#### **Step 2: Define Basic Info**

- **Workflow Name**: Give your workflow a clear title.

  Example: Get MacBook Details
- **Workflow Type**: Choose between:
  - **Scenario** – Triggers based on call behavior or questions.
  - **Knowledge Base Loader** – Used to preload external info into Welco’s knowledge.
- **Workflow Trigger Scenario**: Define when this should activate.

  Example:

  > Trigger this action whenever the caller asks anything about the MacBook.

#### **Step 3: Configure Request Settings**

- **Request Method**: Choose GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE.
- **Headers**: Add any necessary headers (e.g., Authorization, Content-Type).

  Example:

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
Content-Type: application/json
```

- **Query Params**: Toggle on to add query strings.
- **URL Encoded**: Optional toggle depending on your API format.

#### **Step 4: Set Timeout**

Define how long Welco should wait for a response before skipping the action. Default: 20 seconds.

#### **Step 5: Save and Chain Workflows (Optional)**

- Click **Add Another API Workflow** to link multiple steps together.
- You can combine this with other workflows (e.g., intake form, transfer call).

### **Best Practices**

- Always test your API separately before adding to Welco.
- Use scenarios with clear triggers to prevent misfires.
- Keep timeouts short for responsive call flow.
- Secure your endpoints and use authentication tokens (e.g., Bearer keys).

### **Sample Use Cases**

- Fetch appointment availability from your backend.
- Retrieve pricing or availability by product name.
- Submit caller details to your CRM in real time.
- Pull up customer records from a phone number match.
