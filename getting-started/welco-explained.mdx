# Welco Structure Explained

Welco AI Receptionist is built on a layered architecture that combines AI intelligence with customizable business logic. Understanding this structure helps you configure your receptionist effectively and troubleshoot issues when they arise.

## System Architecture Overview

Welco operates through a hierarchical system where each layer serves a specific purpose in handling incoming calls:

```
Welco AI Receptionist
         â†“
Core Receptionist â”€â”€â†’ Prompt
         â”‚              â†‘
         â”‚         Knowledge
         â†“
Workflows as Skills
    â”œâ”€â”€ Workflow 1
    â”œâ”€â”€ Workflow 2
    â””â”€â”€ Workflow 3
```

## Core Receptionist

The **Core Receptionist** is the foundation of your AI phone system. It acts as the central processing unit that:

### Primary Functions

- [**Call Routing**](https://docs.welco.ai/phone-number-setup/business-hours): Determines how incoming calls are handled
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation context throughout the call
- **Skill Coordination**: Decides which workflows to activate based on caller needs
- **Fallback Handling**: Manages situations when specific workflows can't handle requests

### Key Characteristics

- Always active and listening during calls
- Makes real-time decisions about call flow
- Integrates with both prompt and knowledge systems
- Coordinates multiple workflows as needed

ðŸ’¡ **Think of it as**: Your virtual receptionist's "brain" that processes information and makes decisions about how to help each caller.

---

## Prompt System

[The **Prompt** defines your AI receptionist's personality](https://docs.welco.ai/prompting-guide/prompt-engineering-guide), communication style, and basic behavior patterns.

### What Prompts Control

- **Conversational Tone**: Professional, friendly, casual, or formal
- **Response Style**: Direct answers vs. conversational responses
- **Brand Voice**: How your business personality comes through
- **Greeting Behavior**: How calls are initially handled
- **Escalation Triggers**: When to transfer calls to humans

### Prompt Configuration

Your prompt should include:

1. **Business Context**: What your company does
2. **Personality Traits**: How the AI should sound and behave
3. **Communication Guidelines**: Dos and don'ts for conversations
4. **Fallback Instructions**: What to do when unsure

<Info>
  **Important**: The prompt works closely with your knowledge base - they should complement each other.
</Info>

## Knowledge Base

Your **Knowledge** system contains the factual information your AI receptionist uses to answer questions accurately.

### Knowledge Sources

- [**Business Information**: Hours, location, services, pricing](https://docs.welco.ai/knowledge-base-management/text-based-knowledge)
- [**FAQ Content**](https://docs.welco.ai/knowledge-base-management/faq-knowledge): Common questions and their answers
- [**Policy Documents**](https://docs.welco.ai/knowledge-base-management/document-upload): Return policies, terms of service, procedures
- **Product Details**: Features, specifications, availability
- **Staff Information**: Who to transfer calls to for specific topics

### How Knowledge Works

1. **Information Retrieval**: AI searches knowledge base for relevant information
2. **Context Matching**: Finds the best information for the current conversation
3. **Response Generation**: Combines knowledge with prompt personality to create natural answers
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Determines how certain the AI is about its answer

<Tip>
  **Best Practice**: Keep your knowledge base updated and well-organized for the most accurate responses.
</Tip>

## Workflows as Skills

[**Workflows** act as specialized skills](https://docs.welco.ai/workflows/fundamentals/introduction-to-workflows) that your Core Receptionist can activate when specific situations arise. Each workflow handles particular types of interactions or business processes.

### How Workflows Function as Skills

- **Skill Activation**: Core Receptionist determines when to use each workflow
- **Specialized Processing**: Each workflow handles specific business logic
- **Skill Coordination**: Multiple workflows can work together on complex requests
- **Seamless Integration**: Workflows feel like natural extensions of the conversation

### Common Workflow Types

#### Workflow 1: Appointment Scheduling

- **Trigger**: Caller wants to book an appointment
- **Skills**: Check calendar availability, book appointments, send confirmations
- **Integration**: Connects with your calendar system

#### Workflow 2: Order Processing

- **Trigger**: Customer wants to place an order or check order status
- **Skills**: Product lookup, inventory checking, payment processing
- **Integration**: Connects with your e-commerce or inventory system

#### Workflow 3: Support & Troubleshooting

- **Trigger**: Customer has a problem or technical issue
- **Skills**: Problem diagnosis, solution guidance, ticket creation
- **Integration**: Connects with your support system or CRM

### Workflow Coordination

- **Sequential Execution**: One workflow completes, then another begins
- **Parallel Processing**: Multiple workflows can run simultaneously when needed
- **Conditional Logic**: Workflows activate based on specific conditions or caller responses
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when workflows encounter issues

## How the Components Work Together

### Call Flow Example

1. **Call Arrives**: Core Receptionist answers using your configured greeting
2. **Prompt Application**: AI uses your prompt to respond in your brand voice
3. **Knowledge Lookup**: When questions arise, AI searches your knowledge base
4. **Skill Assessment**: Core Receptionist evaluates if workflows are needed
5. **Workflow Activation**: Appropriate workflows activate to handle specific requests
6. **Coordination**: All components work together to provide seamless service

### Information Flow

- **Prompt** guides how information is communicated
- **Knowledge** provides the factual content to communicate
- **Workflows** handle complex business processes
- **Core Receptionist** orchestrates everything smoothly
